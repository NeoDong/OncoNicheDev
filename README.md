# OncoNicheDev
A pipine to analyzing the link between development programs and cancer type-specific drivers via integrative network modeling

# Step 1
Identification of driver gene-centered protein-protein interaction subnetwork (code in subnetwork/)

# Step 2
Extracting developmental programs surrounding driver gene with NMF algorithm and testing the cancer type-specificity 
of each program (code in NMF/)

# Step 3
Comparing the effects of developmental programs on the efficiency of communication between driver genes and downstream transcription factors (code in network communication/)

# Step 4
Gene regulatory network analysis of influenced transcription factors (code in GRN/)
